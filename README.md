## HUMAN NOT REFUGEE
A simple tool that changes perspectives

Refugee is a word that carries fear, and nobody should have known by that. 
We are human beings before anything else, and that’s how everyone 
should been called. We fear, we care, we love and we share, that’s how 
we become human beings, a permanent state.

Let’s change it.

Human not Refugee is an extension for Chrome that changes every “refugee” word for “human being”, a form that we create to change perspectives of news and articles of refugees worldwide.
