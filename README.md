## HUMAN NOT REFUGEE
A simple tool that changes perspectives

Refugee is a word that carries fear, and nobody should be known by that. 
We are human beings before anything else, and that’s how everyone should be seen. We fear, we care, we love and we share, that’s what makes us human beings, a permanent state.

Let’s change it.

Human not Refugee is an extension for Chrome that changes every “refugee” word for “human being”, a way that we believe will change perspectives of news and articles of refugees worldwide.
